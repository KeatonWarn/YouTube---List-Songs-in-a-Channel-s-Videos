# YouTube---List-Songs-in-a-Channel-s-Videos

This Python script retrieves and processes the video details of a YouTube channel, extracting the songs used in each video, and saving the results to a text file. The input is a YouTube channel URL in the form https://www.youtube.com/channel/[channel ID]. The channel ID string isn't in the URL (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/channel/@[channel_name]) it can be found manually on the channel's About page via the Share button.
